# easy-Tor-detect
An easy small program for tor traffic detection based on Pyshark and Cloud-Pcap
The main framework is based on Cloud-Pcap(you can find this project on github)
You can find a "README.md" in Cloud-Pcap project and learn how to establish Cloud-Pcap(it's easy to do! Thanks to the author of Cloud-Pcap)
I add some small functions so that this program can detect Tor traffic by fingerprint
